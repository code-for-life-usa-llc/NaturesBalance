            <h2>Climate Control</h2>
            <p>Climate control refers to the systems and technologies used to regulate and maintain comfortable temperature, humidity, and air quality in various environments. It is commonly applied in residential, commercial, and agricultural settings.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Home Climate Control:</strong> Includes thermostats, air conditioning units, heating systems, humidifiers, and ventilation.</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial Climate Control:</strong> Utilizes HVAC systems, building management systems (BMS), and energy management practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Climate Control:</strong> Employed in greenhouses and controlled environment agriculture (CEA) to optimize growing conditions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth. It is driven by human activities that increase greenhouse gas emissions, leading to global warming and associated impacts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate Mitigation:</strong> Involves strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy efficiency. Examples include renewable energy adoption and carbon capture technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Adaptation:</strong> Adjusting practices and infrastructure to cope with the effects of climate change. This includes designing resilient buildings and improving water management.</li>
                <li><strong>International Agreements:</strong> Efforts like the Paris Agreement aim to unite countries in setting targets for reducing emissions and addressing climate change impacts.</li>
